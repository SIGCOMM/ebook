 Makes comments on Poisson versus periodic probing, and average separation compared to TCP's RTT.
 Wierd reasoning whereby bias decreases and variance decreases when probes sent Closer together! (because looking at ability of probes to measure transient TCP loss).
  Much of the paper is similar to tomo_loss_CDHT_1999, but with some extras details making it less dense, and some proofs omitted. The simulation section is expanded, many empirical results showing variance and closeness to real loss as a fn of ns TCP parameters, with interpretations.}

Actual aim is to locate bottlenecks, loss is used to find the logical tree first, then

Nice intro to reliable multicasting motivating need to know topology, also mtrace later on.
Defines 'true' and `false' shared losses over a set of receivers, ie losses over the shared
path, or separately over both non-shared paths, and then solves the familar basic
scheme (binary two leaf topology, iid losses).
The expression (and estimates) for shared losses are used to coalesce nodes pairwise from
the bottom up, creating a binary tree (one fuses the nodes with the highest probability
over all receiver pairs). Issues in the non-binary case are explored, based on comparing
shared loss probs under different scenarios, with a threshold. Well written.}

Measures link delay variance (not delay itself) over a tree using iid Bernouilli losses, assuming topology known.
Based on fact that covariance over receivers is just variance over shared path.
Quantifies increase of variance due to temporal and spatial dependence, notes consistency regardless provided ergodic.
Looks for optimal convex combination to minimize variance. Details rely on standard theorems but messy
matrix calculations.
Can go to higher moments of shared path at node k if node degree is higher, in terms of the first moment at leaves (in fact, the precise connection is via cumulants).
Incorporates effects of lost packets reducing amount of available data.
Both model and ns simulations.
Mentions that could use delay variance to infer topology (like do in loss work)}

  abstract  = {A number of problems in network operations and engineering call for new methods of traffic analysis. While most existing traffic analysis methods are fundamentally temporal, there is a clear need for the analysis of traffic across multiple network links --- that is, for spatial traffic analysis. In this paper we give examples of problems that can be addressed via spatial traffic analysis. We then propose a formal approach to spatial traffic analysis based on the wavelet transform. Our approach (graph wavelets) generalizes the traditional wavelet transform so that it can be applied to data elements connected via an arbitrary graph topology. We explore the necessary and desirable properties of this approach and consider some of its possible realizations. We then apply graph wavelets to measurements from an operating network. Our results show that graph wavelets are very useful for our motivating problems; for example, they can be used to form highly summarized views of an entire network's traffic load, to gain insight into a network's global traffic response to a link failure, and to localize the extent of a failure event within the network.}
